## Hello! I’m a digital strategist, designer, and art-maker who loves working with code and being helpful.

I’ve been building web experiences for the past 20 years, with a professional background ranging from UX research and design to front-end and back-end development, web accessibility, product management, and beyond. Currently I serve as the Director of Digital Strategy for the University of Texas School of Law.
